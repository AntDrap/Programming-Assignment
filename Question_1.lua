-- Original Code
-- Fix or improve the implementation of the below methods

local function releaseStorage(player)
        player:setStorageValue(1000, -1)
end
    
function onLogout(player)
    if player:getStorageValue(1000) == 1 then
        addEvent(releaseStorage, 1000, player)
    end
        
    return true
end

-- Modified Code

-- Function to complete the logout process, sets the value of player storage at position 1000 to -1
function onLogout(player)
    -- since the "releaseStorage" function is a local function thats called a single time
    -- there isnt much need for it to be a standalone function
    -- so the function can be changed into an lambda function

    -- if the player storage set to 1 then create an event that sets the storage to -1
    if player:getStorageValue(1000) == 1 then
        -- sets the player storage at position 1000 to -1 in 1 second
        addEvent(function(player)
                    -- there also needs to a fail case in the situation where the player object is set to null
                    -- in the second before the event completes
                    if(player == nil) then 
                        return 
                    end

                    player:setStorageValue(1000, -1)
                end,
        1000, player)
    end

    return true
